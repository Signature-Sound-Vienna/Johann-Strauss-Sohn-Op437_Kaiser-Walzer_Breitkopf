# Johann Strauss Sohn: Kaiser-Walzer (Emperor Waltz)

MEI encoding of the Kaiser-Walzer (Emperor Walz), Op.437 by Johann Strauss Sohn (Johann Strauss junior), following the [Breitkopf & HÃ¤rtel edition from ca. 1920](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/834308), as available on IMSLP.

Two encoding files are available in this repository:
    * Kaiser-Walzer_Breitkopf.mei: Encoding of the orchestral score. Should be used for most use-cases.
    * Kaiser-Walzer_Breitkopf-expanded.mei: Expanded (through-composed) version in which the repeat-structure of the piece is unfolded. 

The expanded version of the encoding is automatically generated from the orchestral score version using [Verovio](https://verovio.org), and is intended for use-cases of automated alignment with performance recordings.
